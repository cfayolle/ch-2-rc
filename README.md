## Foundations Checkpoint 2

### Complete the specs

1. Before completing each spec, read the README.md File located in each folder and check the point value for each problem so you know how to prioritize each problem.
2. Write your code in each `solution_*.js` file so that you can pass the specs in located in the `*_specs.js` files
3. Run the test specs to test your code. To run the specs for a directory, you need to go into that directory and run the command `testem`.

```
$ cd foundations-checkpoint-2-R
$ testem
TEST'EM 'SCRIPTS!
Open the URL below in a browser to connect.

```

### Spec Point Values:

- 00 Reduce: 5.00
- 01 Recursive Deep Filter:  8.00 
- 03 - A Quarter: 7.00
  - Note: the last test spec is +2 points extra credit. The whole problem is not extra credit, only the last test spec.

### Submission

When you are passing all the specs, or have run out of time, **commit your changes and push them up to your repository for the Checkpoint to be graded in Learndot**.

Make sure you press **Done** on the Checkpoint 2 Checkpoints Page to submit your Checkpoint when you are finished!

**Example**
```
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m 'completed exercises'
$ git push origin master
```

Good luck!
